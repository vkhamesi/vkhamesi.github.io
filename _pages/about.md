Hello, I'm Victor and I'm currently working as a Data Scientist at Amazon in Edinburgh where I'm exploring opportunities to improve targeted advertising by improving Machine Learning algorithms and running offline statistical experiments. I have freshly graduated from Imperial College London in Statistics and from École Centrale de Lyon, one of French Engineering <em>Grandes Écoles</em>.
